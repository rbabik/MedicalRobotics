# MedicalRobotics
store all of my Matlab and C++/Arduino files for the surgical robot arm project for possible future use by another team

Two main directories exist. The first is for the early MATLAB analysis as well as as the data processing of the 3D end effector results.
The second holds all of the master and slave manipulator embedded software along with another README file to explain those two file packages.
