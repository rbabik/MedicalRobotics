 * CODE OVERVIEW
 * The slave software is event-driven programming with a state machine to control active/updating behavior
 * The main loop is used to constantly check for "interrupts" due to human interaction and also
 * continually manage other aspects that need constant update, such as reference angle readings and 
 * motor commands based on PID controls.
 * 
 * In the state machine file there is a boolean variable to set whether you are communicating master
 * reference angles over bluetooth or tethered connection. By swtiching that varaible, you will switch between 
 * the two modes. NOTE that bluetooth mode is too noisy and has too much latency to be effectively used as is. It
 * is highly recommended that before just "plugging and playing," revisions to the wireless comm method be made. Trying
 * immediately to use BT as is with the full hardware manipulator may damage the motors due to jerky and/or noisy commands.
 * Also note that for BT to work, you must first unplug the tethered potentiometer cables from the master and plug them into
 * the master Arduino Uno, which must also be powered on.
 * Tethered, which is the default, works great!
 * 
 * To use the robot, plug in the 12V power supply on the slave as well as the separate USB power supply for the arduino
 * Then, on the slave flip the start switch to on, and then the slave will begin following the master.
 * Often you need to recalibrate the slave DC motor encoders to effectively mimic the master joint angles, so if this is the case, 
 * then adjus the master links until the slave links (minus the end effector joint as this is servo driven not DC) 
 * both point directly down and the top rotation is at a good orientation to call "zero." Then, on the master just press once the 
 * zero encoder button and now the slave arm will accurately reflect the master configuration.
 * 
 * On the master there is also a fine control switch. When turned on, joint angle adjustments on the master map 2:1 to the slave. 
 * This allows for more fine control of the slave and is intended for use when you have already moved right to the surgical site and
 * can sacrifice a large workspace for more precise control. 
 * 
 * As always, use caution with the robotic arm and operate safely. Monitor heat dissipation in top slave controls box, and be sure to 
 * turn off the system power before ever adjusting electronics. Enjoy!
